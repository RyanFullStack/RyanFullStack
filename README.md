I love learning. I am a fast study, and eager to enhance my experience with any new technologies to enable me to complete my goals. I have a track record of accomplishments and am always looking for the next step forward.

I found coding at a young age and built my first website with HTML at 10 years old. At 18, my passion for flight took over for 15 years. After reaching the top of my field in aviation I was ready to get back to my roots. I'm now happy to call myself a full time developer and fly for fun on the weekends, which is the perfect balance for me.

I want to implement my education in a way that enhances the lives of others and enriches the experience of every user. I love new challenges and am always looking to expand my horizons. I'm currently searching employment that can empower these goals. Please connect with me for more information or for hiring inquiries. Below, you'll find a list of technologies I've previously worked with. I look forward to expanding this list further!
