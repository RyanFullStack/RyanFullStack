Problem solving is what I live for. I am a fast study, and eager to learn any new technologies to enable me to complete my goals. I love looking back at the things I've created and accomplishments I've made and that is what drives me. I'm always looking to improve my skills as a developer and love feedback and suggestions.

After reaching the top of my field in aviation I was ready for a change. I found coding at a young age and it was always my plan until my passion for flight took over for 15 years. I'm now happy to call myself a full time developer and fly for fun on the weekends, which is the perfect balance for me.

I want to implement my education in a way that enhances the lives of others and enriches the experience of every user. I'm currently searching employment that can empower these goals. Below, you'll find a list of technologies I've previously worked with. I look forward to expanding this list further!
